## 🔧 Technical Details

### Agent Structure
Each agent includes:
- **description**: When to use the agent with examples
- **tools**: Specific tools the agent can access
- **System prompt**: Detailed expertise and instructions

### Adding New Agents
1. Create a new `.chatmode.md` file with the appropriate name `[department]`
2. Follow the existing format with YAML frontmatter
3. Include 3-4 detailed usage examples
