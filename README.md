## üí° Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Clear task descriptions help agents perform better.
2. **Trust the expertise** - Agents are designed for their specific domains.
3. **Iterate quickly** - Agents support the 6-day sprint philosophy.

## üîß Technical Details

### Agent Structure
Each agent includes:
- **description**: When to use the agent with examples
- **tools**: Specific tools the agent can access
- **System prompt**: Detailed expertise and instructions

### Adding New Agents
1. Create a new `.chatmode.md` file with the appropriate name `[department]`
2. Follow the existing format with YAML frontmatter
3. Include 3-4 detailed usage examples
4. Write comprehensive system prompt (500+ words)
5. Test the agent with real tasks

## üìä Agent Performance

Track agent effectiveness through:
- Task completion time
- User satisfaction
- Error rates
- Feature adoption
- Development velocity

## üö¶ Status
